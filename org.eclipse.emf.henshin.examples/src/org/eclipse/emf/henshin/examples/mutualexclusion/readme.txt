=== Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithm in Henshin ===

Contributed by Dmitry Zakharov and Christian Krause

This example contains a mutual exclusion algorithm in Henshin which is used
as a benchmark. This example was defined in the following technical report:

http://www.cs.bme.hu/~gervarro/publication/TUB-TR-05-EE17.pdf

The example consists of three different scenarios:

(1) Short transformation sequences (STSBenchmark.java)
(2) Long transformation sequences (LTSBenchmark.java)
(3) As long as possible rule application (ALAPBenchmark.java)
