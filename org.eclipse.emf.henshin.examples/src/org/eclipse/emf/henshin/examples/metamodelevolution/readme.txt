Files in this folder tend to be modified ;-)
Before running Evolution1.main, make sure to copy fresh original files from folder "backup" into this one.

This folder needs to contain the following files (in alphabetic order) in order to apply Evolution.main successfully:

- Net1.xmi: instance model typed over petri.ecore
- petri.ecore: simple meta-model for Petri nets
- petriM.henshin: Henshin file containing rules related to a metamodel e.g. petri.ecore
